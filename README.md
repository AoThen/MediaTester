# MediaTester
MediaTester will test any storage media, such as SD cards, and verify that the reported size is the actual size of the media. The testing method is similar to h2testw but can identify fake or defective media much faster by performing quick reads after each GB is written. 

Fake media sales have reached epidemic proportions. Fake media is being falsely labled with popular brand names including SanDisk, Samsung, Sony, Kingston, and other. Not only are these counterfiet but they often contain less storage than the cards report to the computer. A 128GB SD card may actually contain only 8GB or 4GB of actual space. After filling up all of the real space, the card will respond as if it is storing the data but it is actually throwing it away. The files will look like they exist but they are actually full of null bytes or completely corrupted. Try to read the data and you will find that it is all gone.

MediaTester is released as a public service. If you buy any flash media, you need to use this tool to verify it.

The MediaTester library, GUI, and CLI will be released with a generous open source license very soon.
