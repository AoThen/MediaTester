# MediaTester
MediaTester will test any media, such as SD cards, and verify that the reported size is the actual size of the media. The testing method is similar to h2testw but can identify fake or defective media much faster by performing quick reads after each GB. 

Fake media sales are reaching epidemic proportions. Brand names, like SanDisk, are being counterfeited that do not hold as much data as the media reports. If you buy any media you need to use this tool to verify it.

MediaTester will be released with a generous open source license very soon.
